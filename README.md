# Mouse Gestures for Google Chrome

## Motivation

Smooth Gestures and others are ad-ware and some others are paid.
I don't use all the power of gestures (customization and such), so I decided
to implement a small extension to replace Smooth Gestures.

The code is open source so that people can re-use/adapt/improve/analyse it.

## Supported Gestures

 - Rocker Gestures
   - left+right buttons -> forward
   - right+left buttons -> back
 - Mouse gestures
   - L: back
   - R: forward
   - U: new tab
   - D: pin tab
   - LR: close tab

## TODO

  - Add configuration page
